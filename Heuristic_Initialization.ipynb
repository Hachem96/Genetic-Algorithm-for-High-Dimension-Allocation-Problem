    "<br> We created a new method based on the number of connections of each function. The idea is to initialize the functions that they have the lowest number of connections to their available controllers that they have the highest degree. The number of functions chosen to be initialized in this way is determined by a parameter called by percentage of initialization. For example if the value of this parameter is 0.2. First, We sort the functions in decreasing order based on their number of connections, then we choose the top 20\\% one and we allocate each one to its available controller that has the highest degree."
